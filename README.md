# SCA-Rental

# Brief description:

For our second projects we were tasked with creating an application that included everything weâ€™ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that can be showcased to potential employers.

For our application we chose to create a car rental application that allows the user to book a rental car for a period of time and from a specific location.

When the user lands on the main page they are able to view to the main page however when they click on any of the other functions they will be asked to sign up/login before they are able to view any of the functions further. Once logged in the user is able to view car by location or view all cars. User can select their preferred car and choose the pickup and drop of dates. The user can view their bookings in the profile in the hamburger menu.

# Features Used:

# User Story:
